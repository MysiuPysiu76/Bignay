## Texture Usage

The **Verdant Stem** texture used in this mod has been slightly modified by me.  
The original texture comes from the project hosted at: [More Wood Addon](https://mcpedl.com/more-wood-addon/)

The **Happy, Angry, Derpy, Skull and Anxious Carved Pumpkin** texture variants, as well as the glowing **Jack O’Lantern** variants, come from [Varied Pumpkins](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/variated-pumpkins/) and were created by [Amaro_Lunatico](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/amaro_lunatico/).  

The **Cobbled Basalt, Basalt Bricks, Chiseled Basalt and Basalt Pillar, Acacia, Birch, Crimson, Dark Oak, Jungle, Spruce, Warped Bookshelf and Prismarine Tiles** texture was created by [MCjossic](https://www.reddit.com/user/MCjossic/).  

The Andesite, Diorite, Granite, Dripstone, Calcite variants of Polished, Smooth, Bricks, Pillar and Chiseled block textures come from [ImXR24](https://www.deviantart.com/imxr24)

The **Tree cavity** textures come from [Turfnerf(BuildsZenith)](https://x.com/BuildsZenith)

Used in the Bignay mod with permission from the original creator - many thanks for allowing me to use them!

The mosaic blocks were inspired by the work of people on Reddit and other mods, viewed on Google Images
